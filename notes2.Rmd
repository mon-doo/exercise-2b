## Notes Markdown 2

Here are more of my class notes, taken in R today:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#tidyverse has tons of stringer functions to manipulate text quickly
sciname <- paste(d$Genus, d$Species, sep = " ") #creates character vector of these two columns of data with an added space between, basically pastes these vectors together
sciname <- paste0(d$Genus, " ", ".", d$Species) #basically same but you can paste multiple separate things in between the vectors you're pasting together
unique(d$Genus) #looks at values that are unique, ignores repeats essentially
```
